                <h2>A. Obtain City Indicators</h2>
                <p>City Indicators are a set of data developed and adopted by cities seeking to measure and monitor various aspects of city development. Indicators include raw data and manipulated data in excel sheets and are mainly understood by data scientists.</p>

                <h2>B. Access City Dashboards</h2>
                <p>City dashboards are a visual way to showcase municipal measures and progress. Dashboards are used to profile a city and provide an overview of city development according to a set of key areas e.g. levels of education in a city, access to social services, city finance, economic development, etc.  Dashboards are useful for those involved in policy development, researchers, data scientist, and anybody interested in an overview of their city’s development.</p>

                <h2>C. View Data Stories</h2>
                <p>Showing city indicators and dashboards can be overwhelming for people that are not data scientists or policy makers without adding a narrative to the data.  Dashboards and spreadsheets only tell you what is happening. But, they do not tell you why. Data storytelling is a methodology for communicating information, tailored to a specific audience, with a compelling narrative.</p>
