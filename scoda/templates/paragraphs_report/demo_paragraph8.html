<p>The creation of the wards offers further insight into how the enumerator area data can be used. In the above example the wards were agglomerated into equal sized chunks containing 43 enumerator areas to reveal a r2 value of 0.7. Creating a larger number of pseudo-wards (by agglomerating fewer enumerator areas) reduces the explanatory value - the r2 value drops. By examining the impact of reducing enumerator areas the number of enumerators so combined guidance is given to those wishing to create their own 'pseudo-wards'.</p>

<p>The plot below compares the explanatory value of the projections in a given year (the r2 value shown as percentage on the graph) to the bin size (the number of enumerator areas in each pseudo-ward). Essentially reducing the bin size undermines the explanatory value of the population estimate. If bin size is dropped from the current 43 enumerator areas to 26 then the proportion of unexplained variation in the registered voters rises from 30% to 37%. A drop to 13 results in over half (54%) of the variation being unexplained.</p>

<p>The projections for individual enumerator areas are made available on the understanding that these may be recombined to create elements akin to the pseudo-wards. However the binning of too few enumerator areas is clearly problematic. The size of the resulting problem is shown in terms of the declining explanatory value.</p>

<p>The above model examines the impact of bin size on the utility of the estimates. The explanatory value of the projections will also invariably decline as they reach ever further into the future. However knowing to what extent this occurs can only be known after the fact - possibly in 2022 or 2023.</p>
