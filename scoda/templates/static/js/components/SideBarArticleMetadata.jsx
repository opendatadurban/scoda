On Friday there was an immediate crisis: R1.8-billion was due on Saturday to Citibank, which had declined any roll-overs or extensions, with another R5-billion also due to other lenders. If the loan repayments were not made, or rescheduled, SAA would have defaulted. This would have triggered not only the call-in of all remaining loans to SAA, but also a cross-default call-in of other loans against government guarantees extended to other state-owned entities (SOEs), including Eskom.

However, Gigaba met with lenders on Thursday and clinched agreement to roll-over the other due R5-billion. "South African banks have been quite lenient... There's a willingness to assist," said Gigaba's spokesperson Mayihlome Tshwete, confirming the minister's meetings with lenders.

And National Treasury also put on a brave face. "The appointment of a permanent Chief Executive Officer for SAA, Mr Vuyani Jarana, who will commence his role on 1 November 2017, marks a critical step in ensuring that the airline's turnaround strategy is implemented," it said in a statement on Friday.

SAA board member for audit and risk Akhter Moosa in August told Parliament's public spending watchdog, the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa), the national airline had "negative equity" of R12.2-billion as of March 2017. "So it (SAA) has no funds to operate. So it has to go for some support from the shareholder (government)." Parliament's finance committee earlier this month heard SAA could not pay suppliers in full, and required working capital of R2.4-billion until March 2018.

Lenders have expressed their reluctance to continue to be supportive while the national airliner's board is chaired by Dudu Myeni, also the chairperson of the Jacob Zuma Foundation, according to City Press, which reported Myeni told the board she would stay on "until uBaba (Zuma) goes" when his term as South Africa's president ends after the 2019 elections.
